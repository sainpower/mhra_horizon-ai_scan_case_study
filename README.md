# Case Study (PoC) for Horizon Scanning using Live RSS Feeds & Web Articles
MHRA DS Project - Case Study for RSS Live Feeds &amp; NER

This repository contains work developed for the Horizon AI Hackathon event in London. The project focuses on automating access to live RSS feeds and other trusted online data sources to identify emerging trends and hidden patterns in medical literature. By streamlining data collection and analysis, this solution aims to support faster insights and discovery in the healthcare domain.

# Data Sources

All live connected data sources are openly available for RSS feeds, for example, BBCi and Nature Publications

# Key Variables

Please view articles.csv for entity variable namings

# Technology & Methodology

This project is implemented in Python and follows a modular, step-by-step workflow. core script provides clear guidance through the full lifecycle of processing live RSS feed data... from collection and parsing to analysis and visualisation. Key techniques include Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting meaningful medical entities and Word Cloud generation for visualising emerging themes and trends.
