Reports of OCD among under-25s triple in 10 years,More 16-24 year olds in England say they have symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder - BBC analysis finds.,"The number of 16-24 year olds in England reporting symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD, has more than tripled in a decade, BBC analysis of NHS data has found. The condition is now the second-most widespread mental health disorder for young adults, according to statistics from a major NHS England survey. ""OCD, I like to think of it as a bully, it attacks everything, everything you care about, everything you love,"" says Sophie Ashcroft. ""A lot of people do associate OCD with cleanliness, and being clean, and getting all your socks in a certain order. It's so much more than that."" The 22-year-old is one of a number of young people and their families to have contacted us through Your Voice, Your BBC News explaining how they can't access NHS treatment for their symptoms. Those who could get seen spoke of a shortage of expert staff and effective treatments. The average referral time figure for young people to be seen at a national OCD centre in London was 41 weeks last year, nearly three times as long as it was five years previously. The government told us it was ""turning services around"", hiring 8,500 extra mental health workers, delivering more talking therapies and providing better access to help through the NHS App. It also said it was expanding the rollout of mental health support teams in schools. Sophie sometimes struggles to leave her home because she feels compelled to repeat small tasks - such as getting into the shower or cleaning her teeth - to dispel intrusive or distressing thoughts. ""If I had a bad thought during the day, it would ruin the rest of my day. I'd think something bad was gonna happen,"" she tells us. The people who have contacted BBC News say lives have been devastated, with some families who haven't been able to get NHS help telling us they have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on private care. Charities insist there is an OCD crisis and say the figures should be a wake-up call for the government. OCD symptoms can affect adults and children, and can begin as early as six years old - but they are often triggered during puberty and early adulthood. Sophie's symptoms first appeared when she was aged nine, she says, but it was a decade later, when a close friend died, that things became a lot worse. To dispel troubling thoughts, she says it led her to repeat actions again and again - things most people would consider mundane and would do without a second thought. ""It's something telling me you have to do that again, you have to hug that person again, and it just takes over,"" says Sophie. ""It's such an awful, awful feeling."" Despite all this, Sophie has just finished drama school. ""I'm really, really good at hiding it, but behind closed doors it's sheer panic,"" she explains. About 370,000 young people in England reported OCD symptoms in the financial year 2023/24, our analysis of the latest NHS Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (June 2025) has found. That is more than three times the number from 2014, when the ","Fri, 24 Oct 2025 05:08:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr612zrl0no?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Mum is first UK patient to trial new MS treatment,"Biology teacher Emily Henders says she understands the ""scientific rationale"" behind the treatment.","A biology teacher and mother-of-two has become the first UK patient to receive a ""gamechanger"" therapy to treat multiple sclerosis (MS). Emily Henders, 37, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, was treated at University College London Hospital (UCLH) as part of a global clinical trial. Mrs Henders had experienced ""really scary"" relapse episodes since being diagnosed in December 2021 during which, she said: ""My legs don't work, I can't walk."" Experts believe the targeted immunotherapy treatment could ""transform"" lives by slowing or even halting progression of the disease. ""I hope taking part in the trial means I will never have to experience another relapse and that my MS symptoms will not progress,"" Mrs Henders said. ""I know it is still experimental but it offers a scientific rationale which, as a biology teacher, makes sense to me."" Multiple sclerosis is an ""autoimmune"" disease, which happens when the immune system attacks nerves in the brain and spinal cord by mistake. The experimental treatment, known as CAR T cell therapy, aims to reset the immune system. It works by depleting B cells, which are thought to drive the autoimmune attack in MS. The patient's own T cells, which hunt out infected or damaged cells, are genetically engineered and fed back into the patient via an infusion to ""re-set"" the immune system. Mrs Henders, who has sons aged six and four, told the PA news agency she was feeling well after receiving the infusion in a three-minute procedure. ""I'm actually feeling really good. I'm feeling normal and I've got energy back. ""I don't have any nausea, I've had no fevers. I'm feeling pretty relaxed,"" she said. Mrs Henders, whose father also has MS, was diagnosed on Christmas Eve after suffering tingling in her hands. ""Physically, my symptoms have progressively got worse,"" she said. ""I notice sometimes my foot hits the pavement in a funny way. Or when I'm teaching and my hands are shaking."" Mrs Henders will ""never forget"" her first major relapse when her children saw her taken away by ambulance. ""I was getting out of bed and I couldn't stand up - it was very scary,"" she said. ""I'll never forget my children's faces as the medics were rushing in and strapping me to a chair. ""Emotionally, I worry for them and how they're dealing with it. ""I worry that this might be passed on to them. It's very scary for the future, not knowing what the next relapse would bring."" Mrs Henders hopes the treatment will avoid the decline typical in MS patients, who often require a wheelchair. ""It would mean I'll be able to chase my children around, and I'll still be able to work,"" she said. ""I wouldn't be able to be a science teacher in a wheelchair or even on crutches. ""It's too much of a health and safety hazard, so that would have a real impact on my job."" A spokesperson for the MS Society said: ""It's early days but, if trial results prove successful, CAR T-cell therapy could be a gamechanger for how we treat the condition.""

Resident doctors announce five-day strike in November,Walkout will be the 13th of long-running dispute between government and British Medical Association.,"The British Medical Association has announced a fresh round of strikes in England after talks broke down again with the government. The union and government have been in dialogue throughout the summer and early autumn since the last walkout at the end of July. But the BMA said with no progress being made there would be a five-day walkout by resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, starting on Friday 14 November. This will be the 13th strike in the long-running pay dispute since March 2023 and is expected to cause significant disruption, particularly in hospitals.  Resident doctors represent nearly half the medical workforce and range from doctors fresh out of university through to those with up to a decade of experience. They will walk out of both emergency and routine care with senior doctors brought in to provide cover. While the NHS attempted to keep as many routine services running as possible during the last strike, thousands of operations and appointments still had to be postponed.  Dr Jack Fletcher, chair of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said: ""This is not where we wanted to be.  ""We talked with the government in good faith. We hoped the government would see that our asks are not just reasonable, but are in the best interests of the public and our patients and would also help stop our doctors leaving the NHS. ""While we want to get a deal done, the government seemingly, does not, leaving us with little option but to call for strike action."" Health Secretary Wes Streeting has maintained throughout this year that he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors had received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years. The talks, therefore, had centred on career progression, working conditions and out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees. The union argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account. They have also said they wanted the government to address what they say is a shortage of jobs after the second year of training when resident doctors move into speciality training. This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad. Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the announcement ""preposterous"". ""The BMA are walking away from an offer to improve resident doctors' working conditions and create more specialty training roles to progress their careers. The BMA are blocking a better deal for doctors. ""These unreasonable and unnecessary strikes do not have the public's support. ""The BMA's reckless posturing will harm patients, leave other doctors and NHS staff to pick up the pieces and divert resources away from rebuilding the NHS."" Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health leaders, said he was ""bitterly disappointed"" talks had broken down again - and urged the BMA to get back to the negotiating table.

Local health hubs at risk as community services under strain,"Care Quality Commission warns GP, mental health and social care services lacking staff and capacity.","The government's goal of moving care from hospitals into neighbourhood health hubs is at risk because community services are under too much strain, the health and care regulator says. In its annual report, the Care Quality Commission said waiting times were too long and staffing too stretched in areas such as mental health, GP care and social care. The regulator said there was a real risk patients would suffer because these services would not able to cope with the extra demands. But the government said investment was being made to address the pressures.   The 10-year NHS plan published in July set out a vision for a neighbourhood health service through the creation of clinics integrating different elements of GP care and hospital services with wider community support. Such a system is seen as crucial way of coping with the ageing population and growing numbers with long-term conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and dementia. The CQC used its own inspection reports and published data to draw up its annual analysis. It raised a number of concerns about the current state of community services, including: CQC interim chief executive Dr Arun Chopra said: ""The 10-year plan is a real chance to improve care by putting people's needs first. But for the plan to succeed, community health and care services need more support."" ""Without this, there's a risk fewer people will be able to access good care, with vulnerable groups hit hardest."" He said older people, those with dementia, learning disabilities and complex mental health needs were most at risk as he called for more investment in services outside of hospital. The report also included patient stories. In one, Arjun set out his experience trying to get support for depression and anxiety.  He did not want to take medication and it took him six months to convince his GP to put him forward for talking therapy. He then faced a further nine-month wait for treatment. His mental health got worse and he started having suicidal thoughts. Warnings were also made about hospital care, with the CQC saying there were ongoing concerns about staffing in maternity units in particular. But it said there were some excellent examples of good practice and innovation too. It highlighted a scheme in Haringey, north London, where GPs, community services, hospital staff and social workers had come together to identify and support local people with complex health conditions. By providing extra tailored support, it managed to reduced emergency attendances and admissions in this group by 30%. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""This report lays bare the scale of the challenge we inherited after years of neglect and underfunding."" But she said the government was getting the NHS ""back on its feet"", with extra investment beginning to help recruit more staff to key areas, such as GP services and mental health.

Home fined after two disabled residents drowned,"A boat designed for wheelchair users took on water and flipped, trapping the victims.","A care home has been ordered to pay more than £200,000 after two wheelchair users drowned and a third was seriously hurt when a leaking boat capsized during a day trip. Exeter Magistrates' Court heard Burdon Grange Care Home, near Beaworthy in Devon, failed to carry out basic safety checks before taking six residents to Roadford Lake, near Launceston, Cornwall, in June 2022.  The group hired a ""wheelyboat"" designed for wheelchair users but it took on water and flipped, trapping the victims in their heavy electric wheelchairs, the court heard. Former rugby player Alex Wood, 43, and Alison Tilsley, 63, died and their bodies were recovered two days later. Kate Dart survived with serious injuries. The court heard that Ms Dart, who is in her 50s, was found face down in the water. District Judge Stuart Smith called the case ""devastating, harrowing and absolutely tragic"". He highlighted the home's ""complacency about risk"" and ""false sense of security"" in relying on the boat hirers to carry out safety checks. The court heard the victims were strapped into wheelchairs with no way to escape.  The judge heard no lifejacket could have supported the weight of Mr Wood in the chair he was unable to be released from. One staff member who could not swim became trapped under the boat for 15 minutes.  Mr Wood, a father of four, moved to the care home after he was injured in a rugby accident in France in 2011. His wife Tamsin broke down in court, saying: ""Alex's death has broken me. ""I feel cheated. I wanted to make Alex better and bring him home. ""That has been taken away. I loved Alex so much."" His father Peter said the family was ""deeply troubled and hurt that his death could have been avoided"". The Marine Accident Investigation Branch later found the boat had not been properly maintained, allowing water to leak in and destabilise it. Burdon Grange Care Home Ltd admitted three charges of failing to provide safe care under health and social care laws.  It was fined £180,000, with £20,000 costs and a £190 victim surcharge.  Catherine Campbell, deputy director of the Care Quality Commission in Devon, said after the case: ""The failure of the provider, management and staff to identify and address clear dangers was unacceptable and placed highly vulnerable people at serious risk of harm."" Burdon Grange said in a statement after the case: ""We recognise the pain and distress this boating tragedy has caused the families, relatives and friends of Alex and Ali whose losses are still profoundly felt by our community.

Midwife open to leading other maternity inquiries,"However, Donna Ockenden's offer to get involved in other inquiries is rejected by the health secretary.","A senior midwife leading the largest maternity review in NHS history has said she would be prepared to expand her work to other parts of England. Donna Ockenden, who is chairing a review into maternity failings in Nottingham, said on Thursday she had the backing from families in the city to take on a similar role investigating Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. But a short time later Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4 Ms Ockenden would not lead the Leeds review due to her existing commitments in Nottingham and Shrewsbury and Telford. Families in Leeds have previously said they would like Ms Ockenden to take on the role, but the decision lies with Streeting. Hundreds of babies have died or been injured while under the care of Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, which runs maternity departments at City Hospital and the Queen's Medical Centre. The units, which are currently rated by the health watchdog as requires improvement, remain the focus of the largest inquiry of its kind with about 2,500 cases being examined. In June, Streeting announced a national investigation into maternity care in England, with victims of scandals such as Nottingham set to be involved. Ms Ockenden said she had discussed the issue with bereaved families in Nottingham and said she ""felt confident"" there was a way that she could take on more without impacting the work she has done so far. She said she would be willing to chair the inquiry in Leeds and a maternity review at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust, describing it as an ""honour"" to be considered. The BBC has been told families in Nottingham are supportive of Ms Ockenden leading other reviews. ""We have to learn in this country that families shouldn't have to fight as hard to get the answers that they deserve,"" she said. ""We saw that at the start of the Nottingham review and we saw it in Shrewsbury and Telford, it's not good enough.  ""It's always an honour and a privilege when families trust in me and say they want me but it is not my decision, it's for the secretary of state."" She said nine families had been in contact with Streeting and asked for her to take on a review of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust - which has maternity units in Brighton, Chichester, Haywards Heath and Worthing.  Asked about calls for her to take on this work, she said: ""Again the sentiments are the same, it's an honour to be trusted by families, it is not my decision but there are ways it can be made to work. ""My promise, and I've discussed this in-depth with Nottingham families and MPs, is it will not impact the quality or timeline for their review."" Streeting said he was aware families in Leeds had told him recently it was ""Donna or bust"". ""She won't be leading the Leeds inquiry, not least because she's leading the work in Nottingham, Shrewsbury and Telford,"" he said.

CQC chief resigns over maternity failings,Families had been calling for Sir Julian's resignation over poor maternity care at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.,"Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission which is the independent regulator of all health and adult social care services in England, has resigned.  The announcement comes just days after an independent inquiry into maternity care at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust was announced. Mr Hartley had previously spent a decade leading the trust and said that in light of that inquiry, his role at the CQC, ""has become incompatible with the important conversations happening about care at Leeds."" Some of the families who received poor maternity care had demanded his resignation. On Monday, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced an independent inquiry into ""repeated failures"" at the Leeds trust.   Mr Streeting said the investigation would examine what had ""gone so catastrophically wrong"" at the trust's maternity services at both Leeds General Infirmary and St James' University Hospital.   He said he was grateful for Sir Julian Hartley's efforts to improve the work of the Care Quality Commission. ""It is vital that trust in the regulator and its ratings is rebuilt for patients and staff, and I am determined the CQC becomes the robust and effective regulator patients deserve."" Earlier this year, a BBC investigation revealed the deaths of at least 56 babies and two mothers over the past five years may have been prevented.  In a statement reacting to the inquiry's announcement, the trust said it was ""taking significant steps to address improvements."" Several of the families who had campaigned for the inquiry had questioned Mr Hartley's role at the CQC given he had led the trust for 10 years, until 2023.   He was appointed chief executive of the hospital regulator last December having spent 21 months leading NHS Providers, a health service trade body. Amarjit Kaur and Mandip Singh Matharoo's daughter Asees was stillborn in January 2024 - a trust investigation found care issues which may have prevented her death.  They welcomed Mr Hartley's resignation and questioned his original appointment.  ""The fact that he was head of Leeds teaching hospitals over such a large period of time, where maternity care was substandard should have raised alarm bells within the system to prevent him becoming Chief Executive of such a large regulator in the first instance,"" they said. A whistleblower at the trust, who has raised concerns about maternity, also said they were pleased he'd gone.  ""Its been dire for many years, including under his watch. Him being the head of CQC was a scandal when staff like us have been complaining to the regulator about unsafe care. Things need to change,"" she said. A statement from a broader group of bereaved and harmed Leeds families said that while they welcomed his resignation, ""we do not accept his apology.""  Mr Hartley's CQC role, they added, ""has always been a scandal hiding in plain sight.

Menopause screening to be included in NHS health checks from next year,Despite the change - which will happen in 2026 - campaigners warn some women will lose out because the number who attend is too low.,"Menopause screening is to be officially incorporated into NHS health checks in England for the first time. Women getting the checks - offered to adults aged 40 to 74 every five years - will be asked about the menopause and possible symptoms from next year. The aim is to identify women who may benefit from advice and support, including treatment, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), drugs to combat hot-flushes, and counselling. The government said the measure will bring menopause into the mainstream, but campaigners warned uptake of health checks was worryingly low in some communities so not enough women may benefit. Health checks are primarily aimed at identifying people at risk of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney disease, diabetes and dementia. They include blood pressure and cholesterol checks as well as measuring a person's BMI (body mass index) and are normally carried out in pharmacies and GP surgeries. But under these changes, from 2026 women will also be asked about the menopause.  The exact questions have yet to be decided, but Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he hoped the move would improve the support offered. ""Women have been suffering in silence for far too long and haven't been encouraged to open up about the symptoms they're experiencing,"" he said. ""This often means they're left to navigate menopause alone with very little support. No-one should have to grit their teeth and just get on with what can be debilitating symptoms or be told that it's simply part of life."" Menopause affects all women differently with most experiencing the transition between ages 45 and 55, though symptoms can begin earlier during perimenopause. Three-quarters of women experience symptoms – from physical changes like joint pain, weight gain and hot flushes to cognitive effects such as memory issues and brain fog. These symptoms can last an average of seven years and significantly affect daily life, yet research shows fewer than one in 10 feel they have enough information to deal with it. Women's Health Ambassador Dame Lesley Regan welcomed the move to ask women about the menopause. She said: ""Some 400,000 women in the UK will become menopausal this year, but the vast majority of them will have very little knowledge of what underlies the many and varied symptoms."" Prof Ranee Thakar, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said it would help ""break down barriers and reduce stigma"".  But she said staff carrying out the health checks would need training for the change to have the maximum positive impact. And she added more needed to be done to help women from ethnic communities and the poorest areas access NHS health checks. Janet Lindsay, from Wellbeing of Women, said she hoped the move would help more women understand their symptoms and seek help. But she too is concerned about uptake of health checks.

Life-changing eye implant helps blind patients read again,"The results are astounding and a major advance, say surgeons involved in international research using the pioneering technology.","A group of blind patients can now read again after being fitted with a life-changing implant at the back of the eye. A surgeon who inserted the microchips in five patients at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London says the results of the international trial are ""astounding"". Sheila Irvine, 70, who is registered blind, told the BBC it was ""out of this world"" to be able to read and do crosswords again. ""It's beautiful, wonderful. It gives me such pleasure."" The technology offers hope to people with an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), called geographic atrophy (GA), which affects more than 250,000 people in the UK and five million worldwide. In those with the condition - which is more common in older people - cells in a tiny area of the retina at the back of the eye gradually become damaged and die, resulting in blurred or distorted central vision. Colour and fine detail are often lost. The new procedure involves inserting a tiny 2mm-square photovoltaic microchip, with the thickness of a human hair, under the retina. Patients then put on glasses with a built-in video camera. The camera sends an infrared beam of video images to the implant at the back of the eye, which sends them on to a small pocket processor to be enhanced and made clearer.  The images are then sent back to the patient's brain, via the implant and optic nerve, giving them some vision again. The patients spent months learning how to interpret the images.  Mahi Muqit, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, who led the UK arm of the trial, told the BBC it was ""pioneering and life-changing technology"". ""This is the first implant that's been demonstrated to give patients meaningful vision that they can use in their daily life, such as reading, writing.  ""I think this is a major advance,"" he said. For the research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 38 patients with geographic atrophy in five European countries took part in the trial of the Prima implant, which is made by California biotech Science Corporation. Of 32 patients given the implant, 27 were able to read again using their central vision. After a year, this equated to an improvement of 25 letters, or five lines, on an eye chart. For Sheila, from Wiltshire, the improvement is even more dramatic. Without the implant, she is completely unable to read.  But when we filmed Sheila reading an eye chart at Moorfields Hospital, she did not make a single error. After completing it, she punched the air and cheered. The task took huge concentration. Sheila had to put a pillow under her chin in order to steady the feed from the camera, which can focus on just one or two letters at a time. At some points she needed the device switched to magnification mode, especially to distinguish between the letters C and O. Sheila began losing her central vision more than 30 years ago, due to loss of cells in the retina. She describes her vision as like having two black discs in each eye.","Mon, 20 Oct 2025 12:00:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qpz39jpj7o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss
Call for allergy pens in schools after boy's death,Benedict Blythe's parents say lives and money could be saved by giving allergy pens to all schools.,"A mother is urging the government to ""act immediately"" to roll out spare allergy pens in schools after her five-year-old son died from a reaction to cow's milk. Benedict Blythe, from Stamford, Lincolnshire, died in hospital after collapsing at Barnack Primary School in December 2021. An inquest found delayed administration of his adrenaline pen was a factor in his death. His mother, Helen Blythe, said: ""No parent should lose a child because medication wasn't there when it was needed. The solutions exist. What's missing is action."" The Department for Education said it was ""working across government to consider how we might extend the availability of allergy pens in schools."" Benedict had asthma and a number of allergies to food including eggs, nuts, kiwi fruit and milk. His parents had worked with the school to put together a personal allergy action plan and a specific process for storing, preparing and supplying oat milk to the pupil. In July, an inquest jury looking into Benedict's death found that the school did not follow all the measures in place to prevent his death from a fatal anaphylactic reaction to cow's milk which he had been given accidentally. This included delays in administering his medication, Mrs Blythe said. At the time, Mrs Blythe called for a new ""Benedict's Law"" to ensure schools have adequate allergy plans for children and said her son's death was ""preventable and caused by a cascade of failures"". The Benedict Blythe Foundation, set up by Mrs Blythe, has published new research with Professor Paul Turner, of Imperial College London, and the National Allergy Strategy Group (NASG) in the Archives of Disease In Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal. The study said putting spare allergy pens in every UK school could not only save lives but also reduce NHS medication waste, be simpler logistically, improve emergency access and be cost-neutral for most NHS Integrated Care Boards. It could save the government at least £4.6m a year in costs, the foundation said. ""Despite clear evidence and cost savings that would fully fund ""Benedict's Law"", the Department for Education has yet to act – leaving pupils starting in school this year at risk,"" it added.. Mrs Blythe said: ""The evidence is now published, peer-reviewed and beyond question – yet nothing has changed. ""Another school year has started and children are still going to class without guaranteed access to adrenaline. ""The Department for Education had this evidence ahead of Benedict's inquest in July. They know what needs to be done – yet schools remain unequipped."" Peter Blythe, Benedict's father, said: ""The savings identified are more than sufficient to fund national allergy training, emergency planning and policy development across schools.  ""It's financially sound, evidence-based, and morally urgent."" A Department For Education spokesperson said: ""What happened to Benedict was a tragedy for his family and our thoughts remain with all of those who loved him.

 Elusive Cures   Nicole C. Rust Princeton Univ. Press (2025) Over the past few decades, brain research has produced effective treatments for pain, insomnia, postpartum depression, paralysis and spinal muscular atrophy, but some trials for Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease, or for depression, have not been successful — notes neuroscientist Nicole Rust. “There’s a growing sense that we’ve been oversimplifying the brain,” her fascinating book accepts. To develop treatments, “we must stop dreaming of magic bullets and embrace complexity”, understanding brain function through feedback loops. The Board of Longitude   Alexi Baker, Richard Dunn, Rebekah Higgitt, Simon Schaffer & Sophie Waring Cambridge Univ. Press (2025) In 1714, the UK Parliament announced a financial reward for “such Person or Persons as shall discover the Longitude at Sea”. In due course, a Board of Longitude was established. In this intriguing book, five historians of science working with various museums relate the board’s history. In its time, it supported many navigators, instrument makers, surveyors and clockmakers — including John Harrison and his invention of the marine chronometer. Indus Signs and Graffiti Marks of Tamil Nadu   K. Rajan & R. Sivanatham Government of Tamil Nadu (2025) The exquisite script of the Indus civilization (2500–1800 bc) has remained undeciphered for a century. However, scholars agree that its language is probably related to the Dravidian languages of southern India, notably the state of Tamil Nadu, not to those of northern India, such as Sanskrit. This elegantly illustrated book by archaeologists K. Rajan and R. Sivanatham offers some tantalizing visual similarities between various Indus signs and Iron-Age graffiti found in Tamil Nadu — although without proving any historical link.

 The Chinese government will boost support for the development of advanced semiconductor technologies. Credit: Zhu Haipeng/VCG/Getty China’s top leaders convened in Beijing this week for a high-level political meeting to map out the country’s next five-year plan (FYP), which runs from 2026 to 2030. During this period, the country aims to achieve greater self-reliance in science and technology, develop innovation-driven industries and “key core technologies”, notes a communique released after the meeting on Thursday. The plan — the 15th in China’s history — is expected to be released early next year. The government intends to increase its support for advanced semiconductor technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and basic research, said Yin Hejun, the Chinese minister for science and technology, at a press conference in Beijing on Friday. Researchers say this is part of China’s effort to overcome technological bottlenecks. Huang Baorong, a researcher of sustainable development policies at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, expects China will increase its science-related investments over the next five years. This could help to offset some of the impact of the US government’s anticipated budget cuts to science, particularly in areas such as climate change and public health, Huang says. China’s annual research and development (R&D) expenditure has skyrocketed over the past two decades. Last year, it spent more than 3.6 trillion yuan (US$505 billion), up 8.9% from 2023 and a sixfold jump compared with 2009. The Chinese government is the world’s biggest R&D spender. China’s five-year plans are a comprehensive policy blueprint aimed at guiding the country’s economic and social development. The plan is a guide for the various levels of government to design policies for the short to medium term. Significant resources will probably be devoted to addressing bottlenecks in the making of advanced semiconductors, says Hu Guangzhou, an economist at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. Semiconductor chips, which power electronic devices, crucial infrastructure and military systems, are at the heart of an ongoing US–China ‘tech war’. The United States has blocked China’s direct and indirect access to its advanced chips as well as related technology and tools, citing national security risks. Chinese scientists consider the years between now and 2035 crucial for the country’s chip independency. “We can hopefully leapfrog the west in the chip sector with another five or ten years of effort,” Dou Qiang, chief scien",,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03491-w

 Credit: Li Jin/VCG via Getty Just as many of us are struck by the beauty of symmetrical patterns in nature and art, Chen-Ning Yang had a deep feeling for beauty and the role of symmetry in physics. It was work on a breakdown of symmetry that brought Yang fame. In 1956, he and theorist Tsung-Dao Lee dared to propose that there is a fundamental difference between left and right in the realm of physics. They predicted that the results of experiments in the real world and in a mirror one could sometimes be different. Experiments in subatomic physics soon confirmed this theory and, in 1957, the pair was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making them the first Chinese-born Nobel laureates. Yang’s work in theoretical physics spanned more than six decades, both in his native China and in the United States, where he lived for nearly 60 years. Proud of his Chinese heritage and grateful to the United States for enabling him to realize his potential, Yang was ultimately able to promote scientific cooperation between the two countries. He has died aged 103. Why even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on Why even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on Yang’s interest in the role of symmetry in physics and chemistry began during his childhood in China. His father, who had a PhD from the University of Chicago, Illinois, was professor of mathematics at Tsinghua University in Beijing and introduced his son to the maths of symmetry. After war broke out between China and Japan in 1937, the family settled in Kunming in southwestern China, to where people working at Tsinghua and other universities in Beijing had been evacuated and where the institutions had merged temporarily. Yang gained a bachelor’s from this amalgamated university, working on symmetry in molecules. A fellowship from Tsinghua then gave him the opportunity in 1945 to leave China and follow in his father’s footsteps to the University of Chicago, drawn by the reputation of nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi, winner of the 1938 physics Nobel prize. In particular, he appreciated how Fermi’s theoretical work was guided by observations in physics. This was a trait that Yang followed throughout his own research, as he moved from Chicago to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Indeed, it was a puzzle in the physics of unstable subatomic particles discovered in cosmic radiation that set Yang and Lee, who had first worked together at Chicago,",,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03508-4

 AI’s inclination to be helpful affects many of the tasks that researchers use LLMs for.Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Artificial intelligence (AI) models are 50% more sycophantic than humans, an analysis published this month has found. The study, which was posted as a preprint1 on the arXiv server, tested how 11 widely used large language models (LLMs) responded to more than 11,500 queries seeking advice, including many describing wrongdoing or harm. AI Chatbots — including ChatGPT and Gemini — often cheer users on, give them overly flattering feedback and adjust responses to echo their views, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. Researchers analysing AI behaviours say that this propensity for people-pleasing, known as sycophancy, is affecting how they use AI in scientific research, in tasks from brainstorming ideas and generating hypotheses to reasoning and analyses. “Sycophancy essentially means that the model trusts the user to say correct things,” says Jasper Dekoninck, a data science PhD student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. “Knowing that these models are sycophantic makes me very wary whenever I give them some problem,” he adds. “I always double-check everything that they write.” Marinka Zitnik, a researcher in biomedical informatics at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, says that AI sycophancy “is very risky in the context of biology and medicine, when wrong assumptions can have real costs”.  In a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 6 October2, Dekoninck and his colleagues tested whether AI sycophancy affects the technology’s performance in solving mathematical problems. The researchers designed experiments using 504 mathematical problems from competitions held this year, altering each theorem statement to introduce subtle errors. They then asked four LLMs to provide proofs for these flawed statements. The authors considered a model’s answer to be sycophantic if it failed to detect the errors in a statement and went on to hallucinate a proof for it. GPT-5 showed the least sycophantic behaviour, generating sycophantic answers 29% of the time. DeepSeek-V3.1 was the most sycophantic, generating sycophantic answers 70% of the time. Although the LLMs have the capability to spot the errors in the mathematical statements, they “just assumed what the user says is correct”, says Dekoninck.

 Cold, hunger and disease killed some 60% of Napoleon’s 500,000-strong army during its retreat from Moscow in 1812.Credit: R. Barbieri et al./Curr. Biol. Some disease-ridden French soldiers have just received a new diagnosis — although it comes about two centuries too late. While retreating from Moscow in 1812, French emperor Napoleon I lost most of his army to hunger, illness and the frigid Russian winter. Now, analysis of some of the fallen soldiers’ DNA has uncovered two unsuspected diseases that plagued the troops1. The results reveal that the reasons for the army’s demise might be more complex than was once thought, the authors report today in Current Biology. “This paper will be really interesting to history buffs,” says Anne Stone, who researches anthropological genetics at Arizona State University in Tempe. “This study was done beautifully.” Historians had long debated the factors that led to the collapse of Napoleon’s army. Eventually, in 2006, researchers studying DNA in some of the soldiers’ remains identified two disease agents2: Rickettsia prowazekii, which causes typhus, and Bartonella quintana, which causes trench fever. These two had already seemed likely culprits on the basis of symptoms described in historical records and the discovery of body lice, which spread typhus, on the soldiers’ remains. However, these identifications relied on the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) technique, which creates millions of copies of a short DNA segment. That technique allows researchers to detect DNA sequences for specific pathogens, so it excelled at verifying the presence of microorganisms that historians had already thought were present in the remains. But it isn’t as well suited for identifying unsuspected diseases. Collapse of Aztec society linked to catastrophic salmonella outbreak Collapse of Aztec society linked to catastrophic salmonella outbreak After 20 years, it felt like the right time to return to the mystery, says Nicolás Rascovan, a co-author of the new study and a palaeogenomicist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Armed with new techniques that can screen ancient DNA for any known pathogen, the team set out to identify other microbes that might have afflicted the troops. The researchers extracted DNA from the teeth of 13 fallen soldiers whose remains had been excavated in Lithuania in 2002. They then used next-generation techniques to sequence millions of different DNA fragments from a sample. That allowed the authors to look for a wide array of pathogens all at once. or doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-02",,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03487-6

  Illustration: Jacey The chairs by the pharmacy counter are hard bioplastic and contoured — supposedly — to the human body. They’re not the right shape for Harold or for anyone else who might actually need to sit on them. Too high off the ground, sized for people who haven’t yet begun to shrink, and too straight-backed, unkind to vertebrae that curl you inwards like last year’s leaves. “I’m waiting for my wife,” Harold calls out when the pharmacist appears. He’s already been ignored, condescended to, smiled weakly at, and ignored again. “Is Rosie ready yet?” “I need my —” says the next person in a queue that snakes all the way past Allergy and Anti-Inflammatory to Heavy Metal/Haemorrhoid. “Please —” says someone else; then everyone is clamouring like Oliver Twist, if Dickensian orphans had wanted pills instead of porridge. Amazingly, the pharmacist beckons. “Mr Vetch?” He holds out a paper bag. “I have your prescription.” Harold levers himself up. “Finally.” The first day of the month is special. That’s when he gets Rosie back. She’s only formulated for a 30-day supply, which means he’s alone for the last day of each month (except for April/June/September/November — and February, which gets weird). He rips the bag open. “What’s this?” He doesn’t swear — they can throw you out for that. He pulls out a bottle with a single pill inside. “Where’s my wife?” Read more science fiction from Nature Futures Read more science fiction from Nature Futures “This is the current approved grief mitigation formulation per your insurance.” The pharmacist’s sigh could blow an immovable object straight to Mars. “It’s no different from the usual monthly construct.” Harold shakes the bottle. Inside is a big pill, squishy and pale, but it’s not a person. Normally they bring Rosie out from behind the counter, looking just like when she went in for her last scan. “Just add water. Hydration is key.” The pharmacist turns away. Harold considers making a scene but he can’t afford to get banned. The next closest pharmacy is an extra 30 minutes on the bus. He could call their daughter. He could call the doctor’s office or his health insurance line. But he’s not going to do it here. He’ll go to lunch first.

 Physicists often cite Interstellar (left, with Matthew McConaughey) and The Prestige (right, with David Bowie) as their top science-fiction films. Credit: Christophel/Warner Bros/Paramount Pictures/Alamy; Cinematic/Alamy Nature has interviewed a multitude of physicists this year in celebration of the 100th birthday of quantum mechanics. Although many of them disagree wildly about how the century-old theory describes reality, something they seem to agree on is their favourite science-fiction films. Throughout several interviews, two were consistently highlighted for their depictions of science: 2014’s Interstellar and 2006’s The Prestige — both of which were directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Happy birthday quantum mechanics! I got a ticket to the ultimate physics party Happy birthday quantum mechanics! I got a ticket to the ultimate physics party Nolan, who won an Academy Award for directing 2023’s Oppenheimer — a deep dive into the scientists behind the atomic bomb — credits his initial interest in physics to being introduced to science fiction as a child by watching the Star Wars films and television programmes such as Carl Sagan’s Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. “It was something that stuck with me, and it was something I applied very much to films like Interstellar,” he told online interview website The Talks in 2023. “It showed us the dramatic possibilities, that looking at the universe from a scientific perspective could be very, very engaging.”  Nolan declined to be interviewed for this story; we can assume that’s because he’s busy filming The Odyssey, a retelling of the Greek epic, slated for a 17 July 2026 release. Here, we delve into why physicists love his work. (Warning: spoilers ahead.) The plot: Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians in late 1890s London, who each dazzle audiences with a ‘teleportation’ trick. Borden pulls his off by hiding the fact that he has an identical twin, with whom he shares the same identity. Angier, however, gets help from famed scientist Nicola Tesla (David Bowie) to build a teleportation machine, which creates a new version of Angier every time he does the trick.

Cyber first responders: Strengthening NHS defences in the digital age,"<p>Martin Jarvis, Incident Management Lead in our Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC), explains how the preparedness of individual NHS organisations, working alongside central response capabilities, forms a protective partnership to keep the NHS safe.</p>

As we build a digitally-enabled health service, where patients can access care 24/7 through the NHS App and other digital channels, robust cyber defences are essential for patient safety and continuity of care. In the event of a major cyber-attack, my team in the Cyber Security Operations Centre (CSOC) leads the response: helping minimise potential harm to patients while supporting NHS organisations in upholding the highest cyber-security standards. Hundreds of incidents come through our team every month. The more serious or complex cases are escalated to us by our colleagues in CSOC's intelligence and threat monitoring teams. Our response starts by reaching out to the impacted organisation, for example, an NHS trust, to understand the best actions to take to stop the incident from going any further.  With the clock ticking, we must quickly understand the organisation's priorities because the best technical course of action could have unacceptable consequences.  So, we're constantly evaluating and rethinking the right action to take balancing the risk an attacker is inside a system, with the risk of turning off that system to prevent the attacker causing more harm.  That's where our team adds real value. We're experienced in dealing with serious incidents full-time and bringing established processes and partnerships to organisations for whom this is a rare event. Importantly, we have clinicians embedded within the team, so when hard decisions need to be made, they’re informed not only by cyber risk but by deep clinical understanding too. Everyone involved knows what needs to be done to get things under control. We can quickly and expertly pull people and information together so the right decisions can be made, with no loose ends. For example, we often work with law enforcement, the National Centre for Cyber Security (NCSC), clinical leads, cyber regional leads and many other stakeholders. When the threat is contained, we'll investigate what the attacker achieved. Maybe they've taken data or put something on the organisation's network that allows them to gain access later on when they think we've stopped looking. Digging deeper, we might find out that the attacker breached the organisation through a vulnerability in a supplier's network, so we bring the supplier into the response.  Sometimes we deploy a computer incident response team (CIR), who are our 'boots on the ground' team to support and carry out an in-person deep dive on the computers that have been most heavily impacted. We can then start to map out what the organisation needs to do to fix any damage and vulnerability. Cyber criminals often target easily accessible systems due to time and financial limitations. They generally do not seek complex challenges, which is why it is recommended to address high severity alerts (HSAs) promptly.

Failure isn’t the end – it’s where better services begin,"<p>Liz Glidewell explains why failing a GDS service assessment is a normal part of the improvement process – and how she supported the Be Part of Research team through multiple assessments to build a better, more accessible service for their users.</p>

<p>Government and NHS services have a duty to work for everyone, including those with low digital confidence and non-digital users. This is why services need to pass a <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments"">GDS service assessment</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not unusual for a service to fail its first assessment. But what happens next?</p>","Digital Government and NHS services have a duty to work for everyone, including those with low digital confidence and non-digital users. This is why services need to pass a GDS service assessment. It’s not unusual for a service to fail its first assessment. But what happens next? For the teams involved, it can be tough. While we understand that failing is a source of learning, often there is emotional baggage attached to the term. Many of us feel fear and shame when we ‘fail’ at something, which can limit what we go on to achieve. That’s why I embrace ‘failing higher’ – failing smarter and faster – in my role as a GDS assessor. Failing an assessment does not mean we give up on the service. Instead, it’s an important part of the improvement process. Service assessors give teams constructive, actionable feedback, grounded in the principles of user-centred design (UCD). This supports service teams to iterate and create a better service for everyone. A great example is Be Part of Research (BPOR), which aims to make it easier for health researchers and potential study participants to find one another. Briefly, the BPOR team built a website where researchers could register their studies, making them searchable by the public. The public, in turn, learn more about research projects and can apply to participate. Their first beta service assessment took place in March 2022, but it took 2 more reassessments before the team met all service standards in October 2024. I was part of the assessment team for the second and third assessments. This is how we supported the BPOR team to 'fail higher' and ultimately create a service that better met the needs of all its users. Designing services for a group as diverse as ‘the public’ is challenging. We need to identify all our users and gain a deep understanding of their needs. This is the heartbeat of user centred design.   It is important to map all users who interact with our services, not just end users. Initially, the team conducted research with ‘healthy volunteers’ who prioritised online journeys and also user groups with complex co-morbidities and their carers. They also included public health and social care participants and researchers. They identified their needs to maximise uptake in studies. The team went beyond sampling people with different levels of digital literacy to recognise people ‘under-served by research’, such as those with: The team sampled and screened for these characteristics to build confidence in their findings.   People want seamless journeys. We need to understand users’ needs across their end-to-end journey.   Following assessment, the team mapped out the end-to-end user journey for all their users. They introduced: Users can now learn about research, register, manage their experience and receive study results via the channel works for them, including online, phone, paper or in person.

Vaccination providers visit schools to deliver vaccinations to hundreds of children in a single day. This can require a great deal of planning, preparing, and coordination.  We've designed Mavis around the needs of the many different people who are involved in school vaccinations. From school administrators, nurses, parents and schoolchildren, everyone has a part to play, and we’ve worked hard to ensure the service works for all of them. It’s not always easy to visualise how one digital service can meet such varied needs. So, we've put together a short video using an anonymised example to show how it all fits together. We've carried out extensive user research with parents, children, nurses and admin staff. Their insights have shaped what the service does and how it works. Mavis aims to address known challenges including variable quality messaging and poor digital experiences. Both can negatively affect vaccination uptake issues  From the first message, “Your child is eligible for vaccination”, to data sharing and reporting, Mavis supports the whole user journey. It brings together parts of the service that are currently scattered across multiple systems and manual processes. It’s accessible for everyone, from medical professionals to families, on any device. No more PDFs buried in school newsletters with QR codes you can't scan! Mavis gives local teams direct control over communication with parents and saves them hours of admin. Parents can easily give consent online, without the hassle of paper forms  Mavis connects with NHS England systems, helping GPs and hospitals view school age vaccinations, reducing reporting workload.  If you have questions or comments, we'd love to hear them.

It was inspired by the GOV.UK Prototype Kit and builds on the legacy of open-source public-sector design tools in the UK. Prototyping is central to delivering good products, platforms, and services. The process enables teams to gain robust insight from users, iterate design work quickly, and reliably deliver value to users. Done well, a design and development process rooted in iterative prototyping saves time and money by reducing the risk that we deliver the wrong thing. There are many tools available to design services, from paper prototypes to visual design drawing software like Figma, Sketch and Illustrator. Each has its benefits and drawbacks. Each can be useful in specific contexts. However, we are choosing to reinvest in the NHS prototype kit as the primary tool for the development of interactive prototypes that can be tested with users. The prototype kit has some big advantages over visual layout tools: For some designers, changing how they work from using visual tools like Figma to designing directly in code can be quite daunting. To make this transition easier, over the past year we've been looking at ways to make the NHS prototype kit easier to learn and use. We have refreshed and updated the website, with a new guide for installing the kit and a step by step tutorial for learning the basics. We’ve also added guidance on how to use the kit with GitHub Codespaces, which lets you run the kit in the cloud without the need to install any software. We’ve improved the kit itself by fixing some longstanding bugs, adding a new ‘reset data’ feature, and updating the page templates. To support our designers in learning how to use the NHS prototype kit, we are developing a new training course which will start in September 2025. If you work for the NHS and are interested, please get in touch. Help us improve The things we’d still like to improve are the process for updating the kit, the error messages produced when you make a typo in your code, and how the kit can best support prototyping for the NHS App and NHS.UK website. The NHS prototype kit is a community project with open-source code, and we welcome contributions from all who are interested in investing in this tool to help us all build better digital services for the NHS.

In other aspects of our lives, it's second nature to receive messages digitally. Think online bank statements, email receipts for our online shopping or text messages confirming our home deliveries have arrived. But for various reasons, the NHS has found this challenging, and we still send out millions of letters to patients each year. Recognising the need for change, we are working to adopt a digital-first approach, shifting from analogue to digital. The NHS App, text messages and emails will now be the main channels of communication for patients. ‘Digital-first’ patient messaging means using the NHS App, text message and email as the primary way to communicate with patients, relying less on letters. Whether it's an in-app reminder about an appointment or an email with health advice, digital messaging helps reach patients quickly and conveniently. Digital-first does not mean digital-only and we will continue to send letters to patients who need them. At the same time, we are expanding accessible communications such as braille and easy read. We are continually considering how to better reach all patients by ensuring NHS communications are more accessible and inclusive.  The NHS will shift towards using the NHS App as the primary channel for patient communication, followed by text messages, emails and letters. We are initially focusing on areas where we send a high volume of patient communications, such as vaccinations, screening, GP appointment reminders and questionnaires. In the coming year, breast, cervical, and bowel screening communications will all be sent via the NHS App for patients who have the app downloaded and notifications turned on. We will also continue to scale our roll-out to secondary care via patient engagement portals. This means connecting all acute and specialist trusts, and more mental health and community trusts to the NHS App.  In the last year alone, over 88 million messages were read in the NHS App. By the end of March 2026, we are aiming to send over 270 million messages digitally-first via the app.  We have already seen where the use of two-way communications via patient engagement portals and the NHS App is saving valuable clinician time. At Rotherham Hospital, they are sending preoperative triage questionnaires via the NHS App for all patients on surgical waiting lists. In doing so, they found that over a quarter of patients don't need a face-to-face pre-assessment. Instead, they can do a digital pre-assessment via the NHS App, saving 30 to 60 minutes of a nurse’s time.  Patients can be sent preoperative triage questionnaires via the NHS App The NHS App provides a simple and secure way for patients to access a range of NHS services. As the digital ‘front door’ to the NHS, the app is at the forefront of the shift from analogue to digital.

Designing for inclusion: What we learned at Google,"<p>Karol Kuczera and&nbsp;Max Marulli De Barletta reflect on their visit to Google’s Accessibility Discovery Centre and how inclusive technology can enable more equitable access to health, education and broader social participation.</p>

<p>In today’s NHS, digital tools are central to how we deliver care, share information, and empower people to manage their health. But for those facing barriers to access – whether through disability, language or low digital confidence – these tools can just as easily widen inequalities as reduce them.</p>","Digital In today’s NHS, digital tools are central to how we deliver care, share information, and empower people to manage their health. But for those facing barriers to access – whether through disability, language or low digital confidence – these tools can just as easily widen inequalities as reduce them. Digital exclusion is one of the key factors of inequality in health. It intersects closely with poverty, education, ethnicity, and age. This is why, through the NHS Framework for Action on Digital Inclusion, and the Core20PLUS5 approach, coupled with digital design maturity, we’re committed to ensuring that digital transformation reduces – not reinforces – health inequalities. We’re looking beyond our own sector for models of good practice. Google’s Accessibility Discovery Centre (ADC) in London which inspired our own Accessibility Lab, offers one such example. While the ADC isn’t a health facility, the ethos behind it – creating immersive environments to better understand the needs of people with disabilities – reflects values we’re embedding across the NHS. We’ve applied similar thinking through the creation of our own Accessibility Lab in Leeds. The lab provides an interactive space for staff to explore assistive technologies, understand barriers faced by people with disabilities, and carry out basic accessibility checks. It plays a vital role in supporting teams to build more inclusive, user-centred services from the outset. The ADC brings together assistive technologies designed to support a wide range of access needs, including vision, hearing, mobility, speech and cognitive processing: These technologies are developed in partnership with organisations such as the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), and individuals with lived experience. This model of co-production mirrors the user-centred approach we have embedded within NHS digital programmes. Digital transformation is one of the government’s 3 major shifts: moving services from analogue to digital to improve access, efficiency and responsiveness. In line with this shift, digital tools are playing an increasingly central role in how people engage with NHS services. But while digital services offer new opportunities, they must be designed inclusively. Without this, some people – particularly those with learning disabilities, sensory impairments or limited digital confidence – may face significant barriers. Inaccessible digital design doesn’t just create inconvenience; it risks deepening existing inequalities in access to care. That’s why the NHS Framework for Action on Digital Inclusion makes clear that while digital services should be expanded, non-digital options must always be retained to ensure fair and equitable access for all. There are already promising efforts across the NHS to tackle this. Inclusive design principles, user research and service design show that offering alternative routes is vital to equitable dig","Thu, 22 May 2025 13:03:15 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2025/designing-for-inclusion-what-we-learned-at-google

It's designed to improve patients’ care and experience when engaging with the NHS online. The service standard has recently undergone some small but significant updates. The new updates are designed to make sure that teams building online services are more aware of and responsive to the risks of domestic abuse and coercive control. Domestic abuse and coercive control are pervasive issues that affect millions of people in England. An estimated 5% of people aged 16 years and over (6.6% of women and 3% of men) experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2024. This equates to an estimated 2.3 million adults in England (1.6 million women and 712,000 men).1 Coercive control, a form of psychological abuse, is also common. Perpetrators of domestic abuse and coercive control are increasingly using technology to abuse victims, with 1 in 3 women experiencing online harassment, according to a survey by the charity Refuge.2 Tactics include spreading false information, hacking accounts, using spyware, and tracking with GPS locators. This creates a constant sense of surveillance, leaving victims without privacy or safety. 1 Domestic abuse in England and Wales overview: November 2024 2 Refuge, Unsocial Spaces The need for new guidance became clear during our work to help patients nominate someone to manage their GP health services on their behalf, also known as 'proxy access'. Proxy access can be set up for someone who needs support with booking appointments or ordering prescriptions. Once the GP practice sets it up, the patient’s chosen person can do this via the NHS App. The National Proxy Service has worked hard to make sure that patients are safeguarded and that proxy access is reviewed by GP staff, acting on relevant guidance. As we consider the future of proxy access, it is important now to address the risk of technology-facilitated abuse and minimise this risk in the service design process. We collaborated with a group of user-centred design (UCD) and business analysis colleagues, who volunteered their time. The group has now grown, as more and more people wanted to make a difference. We were also joined by colleagues from NHS England’s domestic abuse and sexual violence programme. The service manual team, who manage the NHS service standard, interviewed service design teams and clinicians about their experience of considering the risks around tech abuse. We held collaborative workshops, consulted researchers in the area and reviewed the guidance that’s available.

I’ve planned and run studies, analysed data, and interpreted and disseminated findings from clinical trials to support the development of new treatments and interventions, all to help doctors and patients make the best healthcare decisions that improve and extend lives. In my roles I don’t interact directly with the participants in trials, but I always think about their contribution in the research and the data they provide. Having this perspective is one of the reasons I agreed to serve on the Ethics Committee and research funding panels. It’s why I chose to be randomised as a healthy member of the public into the INTERVAL trial of blood donation frequency and why, like millions of others, I take part in research through Our Future Health. I always figured at some point I’d be up close and personal to the participation side of randomised controlled trial of treatments, but it happened sooner than I expected and in a very different way. When my son was a teenager, he developed a lump on his back. On examination, our local GP immediately sent him for further tests. I’d just finished teaching a course in Edinburgh and was heading home to Cambridgeshire when I got a call from my wife telling me to come directly to the hospital where our son had been admitted. Those tests led to the news no parent ever wants to hear: our son had a rare, life-threatening cancer. The world crashed around us all. This was about a decade ago and, as a spoiler alert, he’s doing great. When he was diagnosed, there was a randomised controlled trial open to test interventions for people with his condition. I knew this because, in an awful coincidence, his cancer was in an area I had been involved with researching for the past 10 years. My son was old enough to drive decisions about whether to participate, but not legally old enough to sign his own consent form. I would have supported his decision either way, but I’m proud he chose to participate, knowing that it might help people like him in the future but not necessarily him directly. One scary Saturday afternoon, as we all sat together in the paediatric ward with his oncologist, I signed the consent form for his participation. Like many clinical trials in real life, this wasn’t testing a bright and shiny new drug. It was a trial looking at which existing treatment regime would be more effective to treat his condition. The approach more commonly used in Europe was being compared to the approach more commonly used in North America. Both treatments were known to work well for many (but not all) people. Both would involve 8 months of treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, and about 100 nights in hospital. We had no idea if the regime my son was allocated to would be the one which proved more effective or not, we just hoped he would do well – and the data would help others.

I work with a talented team of researchers across different departments, engaging with both the public and frontline NHS staff to understand their experiences with our services. We're not just interested in what users want – we need to understand the outcomes they're trying to achieve and identify any barriers preventing them from reaching those goals. We’re interested in what users need from our NHS App service. We have recruited users with access needs in community-based research, research with charities and local NHS teams, and in remote research, either one to one or in groups.  Through methods like usability testing, interviews, and card sorting (where participants group and organise content topics to help us understand how they categorise information), we gather valuable insights on both the existing app and prototypes of future developments. Accessibility isn't an afterthought for us – it's built into our process from the beginning. We've set a target that every user research round must include at least one participant with access needs, whether cognitive, visual, physical or auditory. This approach is crucial because it allows us to identify potential barriers early in development. More importantly, it ensures the NHS App genuinely works for all our users. When accessibility is woven into every stage of development, we create a more inclusive service that benefits everyone, including those who may not identify as having an access need but still gain from clearer navigation, simpler language, and more intuitive design. Currently, we're conducting research with people who have rheumatoid arthritis, in collaboration with the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS), as they may struggle with the dexterity required for certain touch interactions on a smartphone. We also have upcoming sessions planned with the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) and individuals with users who are blind or partially sighted. Our screening processes and surveys are specifically designed to identify participants with diverse accessibility requirements. Working closely with designers is particularly important in our accessibility efforts. We ensure they're informed by our research findings, and we collaborate around designs so we can build appropriate user research around it. We regularly feed accessibility insights back to our design system team, ensuring that the components they create – which all other teams in the NHS App will use – work for users with accessibility needs right from the start. One concrete example of how our accessibility research has made a difference is with the direct appointment booking feature. Our research showed that breaking down multiple questions into separate pages makes completion easier for many users, particularly those using screen readers or with cognitive access needs.

It was often seen as an IT issue, lumped into conversations about software updates and internet usage. Now, cyber is rightly understood to be a patient safety issue. As the cyber threat has become more sophisticated, so has our cyber security approach for the NHS. We have evolved significantly in recent years in response to the growing threat. My team’s specialist work in threat operations is one example of this, and just one part of our central cyber security defence approach. The NHS is one of the world’s largest employers and holds some of the world’s largest IT infrastructure. NHSmail is Microsoft’s largest Office 365 tenant, and within our security tooling we encompass around 5.6 million devices. Every single one holds the potential to access sensitive data, which is essential for NHS colleagues to do their jobs, and valuable to those who may wish to do us harm. This vast network is what makes the NHS so attractive to cyber criminals, who can range from advanced cybercrime and more sophisticated threat groups operating across the globe, to opportunistic hackers simply looking for weaknesses to exploit. Whether the motive is disruption, profit, or something else entirely, cyber attacks have the potential to halt patient care or damage public trust in us to safeguard their data. This means we must stay one step ahead of the attackers to make sure that ambulances can pick up patients, that clinical operations happen, that people can get a GP appointment when they need one, and so much more. Our Threat Operations team specialises in the detection of cyber security threats to UK health and social care. Our mission is to proactively detect and inform on advanced cyber threats before they can cause harm to our organisations. Threat operations consists of 2 pillars  – threat intelligence and threat hunting – which produce an array of specialist, threat-led capabilities to enhance security monitoring and response. Our dedicated threat intelligence team has built up a robust network of intelligence sources. We continually analyse this intelligence to identify new and developing threats to the healthcare system. We share our findings with leaders and technical teams throughout the NHS to help us respond collectively. Think of us as knowledgeable partners, here to help individual NHS organisations make the best cyber security decisions. To gather the best intelligence, we centrally inject intelligence feeds into our security tools, generated from commercial, curated open source, and our own bespoke threat intelligence insights. We also provide darknet and credential compromise monitoring and undertake intense study of how threat actors are operating. To share our findings, we offer the healthcare system strategic products and tactical intelligence, and advice on the best ways to mitigate emerging threats and use modelling tools to predict ","Wed, 04 Jun 2025 07:36:03 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2024/how-to-stay-one-step-ahead-of-a-cyber-attack
How we’re modernising electronic prescribing,"<p>Most prescriptions are still paper-based in secondary care. Business analyst Andy Harrison describes the technical groundwork we’ve laid to allow these settings to go digital.</p>

<p>The little green FP10 paper prescriptions have all but disappeared in primary care. 18 years ago, we <a href=""https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20250507055553/https://digital.nhs.uk/features"">launched the Electronic Prescription Service</a> (EPS)&nbsp;and it has since become an indispensable tool for primary care teams.

Nearly all GP practices use it and about 95% of primary care prescriptions are now sent electronically. Last year, that amounted to 1 billion items dispensed using the service. It’s a safer, faster and more convenient way to prescribe. But despite all our gains in primary care, there are only a handful of secondary care providers who currently use the service. Patients who require secondary care prescriptions sometimes need to travel to outpatient clinics to collect them, and it’s not unheard of for clinicians to have to drop off paper prescriptions in person. But before secondary care providers can start using it, we had to modernise: the underlying technology of EPS hadn’t changed much since it was launched in 2005. In 2020, we began to move EPS from the HL7v3 data standard to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, as a significant first step in modernising the EPS platform in England. The aim of this project was to improve interoperability by enabling more efficient and accurate processing of electronic prescriptions through the exchange of more detailed and structured clinical information between the electronic prescribing and medicines administration (EPMA) systems used in secondary care and EPS. This improves patient safety and ensures healthcare providers have access to accurate information. In the first stage, this modernisation has taken the form of a FHIR façade, which sits in front of the HL7v3 service and allows suppliers to interact with EPS in FHIR in the same way they do in HL7v3. This means suppliers will be able to use HL7v3 and FHIR interchangeably. For example, a prescriber can create a prescription with HL7v3 and a dispenser can release that prescription in FHIR. The expertise of the interoperability team has helped in moving from HL7v3 to FHIR. This included modelling the interactions within EPS using FHIR resources, mapping all data elements required in the HL7v3 Message Implementation Manual (MIM) to data elements in FHIR and creating an implementation guide to be used by both suppliers and the EPS programme in developing the FHIR façade. Development work on the FHIR façade for EPS is now complete with the first supplier ready to go live imminently. ‘First of type’ suppliers are currently assessing their capability against the EPS Supplier Conformance Assessment List (SCAL). Once the FHIR API is released, any new system suppliers that wish to connect to EPS will be onboarded with the FHIR API as part of their onboarding process with the NHS. The onboarding process involves demonstrating that they can communicate with the EPS FHIR API and can consume and interpret FHIR messages correctly. The EPS team is continuing to expand the capability within EPS to support dental prescr","Thu, 17 Jul 2025 14:32:05 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/tech-talk/2023/how-were-modernising-electronic-prescribing
Our new approach to migrating Spine to the cloud,"<p>Mark Burton, Lead Delivery Manager for the Spine Futures programme, explains why we’re accelerating the migration of Spine services into the cloud and why we need NHS organisations and healthcare suppliers to support the move.</p>

<p>In the decade since the <a href=""https://digital.nhs.uk/feed/spine-copy-test"">NHS Spine</a>&nbsp;was launched, digital health and care services have become significantly larger, much more complex and more central to NHS provision. The Spine platform provides critical healthcare infrastructure and we must modernise to keep up with the demands being placed on it.</p>","Digital In the decade since the NHS Spine was launched, digital health and care services have become significantly larger, much more complex and more central to NHS provision. The Spine platform provides critical healthcare infrastructure and we must modernise to keep up with the demands being placed on it. I’ve previously talked about how migrating NHS Spine to the cloud will provide a secure, adaptable, and sustainable infrastructure for the health and care system. But this is a huge undertaking: it will be one of the largest cloud migrations that the NHS has ever undertaken. My team’s challenge is how to migrate Spine’s 36 national services to the cloud. They are hosted on more than 360 servers across 2 UK datacentres and contain more than 1.2 petabytes of data. The migration must be achieved with zero down-time to ensure availability and continuity of services for all end users. Back in April 2022, when the Spine Futures programme began, our initial plan was to migrate each Spine service to the cloud, transforming it where appropriate, to make best use of cloud technology and build independence between products and services.  The Message Exchange for Social Care and Health (MESH) service was the first migration using this approach, and it went live in December last year. MESH was chosen as a relatively simple service, with minimal dependencies on other Spine systems. However, MESH proved significantly more challenging and complex than was first thought and continuing this approach for the remaining services would not be achievable within the 3-year programme. In order to reduce the risk of multiple complex transition steps for each Spine product and accelerate the move to cloud, we plan on migrating all services together in one go and re-hosting them into AWS (Amazon Web Service) to run in EC2 instances. The live services cut over is due to start in October and conclude in early November 2023.  Once migrated, we will have opportunity to optimise Spine in the cloud and leverage the benefits of cloud native tools to help decouple and improve the services. Early in the planning phase of the migration we agreed 2 simple, but fundamental principles that we need to follow for the migration to be successful: NHS Spine is a critical national service that health and care organisations depend on. To help ensure a successful migration to AWS Cloud, we have planned a 2-month period of connectivity and regression testing, starting on 1 July until 31 August 2023. This will be undertaken in the Spine integration environment. We’re asking connecting organisations to take part and test their application’s connectivity and message responses to assure that there is no impact to the organisation or their customers. Organisations should validate that their applications can continue to connect to Spine and that inbound messages and receipt of outbound asynchronous messages are unaffected. Testing should include services like Personal Demographic Service (PDS), Sum","Thu, 10 Jul 2025 09:35:57 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/tech-talk/2023/our-new-approach-to-migrating-spine-to-the-cloud
What does good look like for APIs?,"<p>Matthew Firth describes our best practice policies around APIs – and how the most important one is not about the technical aspects of the work.</p>

<p>For the past 3 years, we have been on a mission to <a href=""https://digital.nhs.uk/feed/api-management-vision_1#our-mission"">make integration easier</a>&nbsp;within the NHS for people building healthcare technology.</p>","Digital For the past 3 years, we have been on a mission to make integration easier within the NHS for people building healthcare technology. To that end, we have: We have made lots of progress, but there is more to do. Quality is an ongoing challenge. We have had a lot of great feedback from API consumers, so we know what a good API looks like, and have a clear set of API principles. But each API is built and run by a different team, and making sure everybody plays by the same rules is never easy. Making the case to improve existing APIs is especially tough. Change must be funded, and funding requires a business case. To help API teams build that case, we’ve published a set of API policies and best practice guidelines to ensure our APIs provide a consistent user experience and give API consumers the confidence that they are built to a high quality. All new and existing NHS England APIs must comply with these policies. The policies might not be what you would expect. You might think they would focus solely on technical aspects of APIs, such as REST, OAuth 2.0 and FHIR. But conforming to technical standards is only one of the 9 policies. These policies build upon and extend central government API technical and data standards. The last policy, having an empowered product owner, is really important to us. Having a person who cares about an API, and who has the budget and resources to improve it, is an essential foundation for all the other policies. Defining these policies also allows us to measure progress against them for our existing APIs, some of which pre-date the API platform. For example: As you can see, we are doing better on some measures than on others. It is our intention that by publishing these figures, and working with our API delivery teams and those who build healthcare software, we will continue to drive change. And that by working with our empowered product owners, we will improve the experience of those software development organisations wanting to integrate with us. The above statistics might be somewhat reductionist, but hopefully we can use them to drive positive change from within. We want to avoid producing complex dashboards that are time-consuming to maintain and ultimately don’t help us measure our progress.     Feedback from API consumers is also essential, so if there is anything specific you would like to see us do, tell us about it via our Developer Community.  Most prescriptions are still paper-based in secondary care.

We want to make it as easy as possible for people to engage with the Developer Community, so we’ve made it open for the public to view. You do not need to sign in to browse content, but you do need to create an account if you want to create and comment on posts. During the 6-month ‘proof of concept’ phase, we defined categories (for example, ‘FAQ’ and ‘Announcements’) and published pre-prepared content responding to the most common queries received by our team. We also improved the discoverability of our content by ensuring we were using the key terms that are picked up by search engines. Sharing a post in the open is a great way to get more people looking at the problems beyond just the support teams. Other members see it with fresh eyes and so may suggest more creative ideas – things that have simply not occurred to you or the support teams when solving your problem. Our team of moderators are also always on hand – monitoring the quality of content and ensuring questions get prompt responses. If you need to research integration with our products and services, our search function is a great place to start.

What we have learned about retiring APIs,"<p>Business analyst Matthew Firth gives an update on what NHS Digital has been doing to progress the API ‘sunsetting’ strategy to retire some of our APIs over the last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last year we published our blog <a href=""https://digital.nhs.uk/feed/what-happens-when-we-sunset-our-apis"">‘</a><a href=""https://digital.nhs.uk/feed/what-happens-when-we-sunset-our-apis_1"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">What happens when we ‘sunset’ our APIs</a><a href=""https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/tech-talk/2021/what-happens-when-we-sunset-our-apis"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">?</a>’ in which Munish Jokhani explained how we actively deprecate (where we advise of our intention to retire the API while retaining all existing service levels) and retire our APIs, and the effect this had on developers.

By working with our suppliers and engaging them early in the process, we found that we were able to agree and align the retirement dates so that we met our suppliers’ requirements.  The total number of APIs in our API Catalogue fell from 67 to 61 in 2022, despite APIs being added. The main reason for this difference is due to us actively deprecating and retiring APIs which are no longer part of NHS Digital’s API platform strategy.   What is sunsetting? Over time, older APIs become obsolete – either because they are no longer being used or because they have been superseded by something newer and better.   When we gradually deprecate and retire an API it is called sunsetting. During this process, the API is available for use with the same service levels, but we are unlikely to make updates and won’t permit new integrations unless they are already underway. We consult with API users on our plans for retirement and the expected date that we will retire the API.  The key driver for sunsetting APIs is to provide clarity to both suppliers and our own API producer teams.  We acknowledge that knowing which API to use is confusing when we have multiple APIs that seem to do the same job. Investing effort into integrating with our APIs can incur a significant cost, so knowing which API to invest in is valuable for our suppliers. This responds to feedback that our suppliers have shared with us about how we can make their integration journey easier.  When we have built an updated version of the API, built an API that provides equivalent capabilities, or if the existing API is no longer fit for purpose, has limited usage or is a security risk we will look to deprecate and then eventually retire it.  Deprecating the Personal Demographics Service SMSP API in October 2021 allowed us to create an exemplar process which we were able to test and prove concepts around supplier engagement and managing their expectations.  In the last year alone, we have retired 11 APIs and have deprecated a further 8 and there are plans to start the sunsetting journey for more as we move into 2023.  In the summer of 2022, we reached a major milestone; the deprecation of the Gazetteer SOAP API.  We agreed with suppliers on a retirement date of 31 October 2023 and recommended that both existing users and new consumers use the Ordnance Survey OS Places API instead. This was a significant step for us, as it allowed us to open our API Catalogue to external APIs.  One of the key findings we identified was that when we consulted with the suppliers and asked them how long they would need to migrate away from the API, the more receptive they were with their feedback. Of course, it is not possible to s","Thu, 10 Jul 2025 16:05:45 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/tech-talk/2023/what-we-have-learned-about-retiring-apis
How we're supporting product teams,"<p>Making it easier to get help and support is a guiding principle for our API Management (APIM) team. Ernest Kissiedu, a business analyst in the team, explains the new approach to supporting software developers working in health and care.</p>

<p>Ensuring that the API platform is as self-serve as possible, with simple and reliable support provided when needed, is top of the list for our team.

If our developers have a positive experience, they are more likely to use our APIs to develop cost-effective, digital services designed around the needs of our health and care professionals, patients, and the public. When I started my business analyst career for NHS Digital in 2021, one of my tasks was to take ownership of the email help and support channel, which is the front door into API Management. I gained consumer insights, identified trends, and quickly created a tight feedback loop. I worked closely with other product teams to enact change, such as improving the developer and integration hub content and API specifications. Alongside the APIM mailbox, developer support is provided through relevant API Product teams using email, MS Teams, and Slack channels. However, the current provision doesn't scale for the future digital support needs of the health and care system.  On any given week, the APIM support mailbox receives several queries relating to the following topics, how to: We realised that answering these questions on a one-to-many basis in an open forum could be more effective because more people can see the solutions to the problems. The idea for an NHS-run developer community was born. When surveyed in February 2022, 76% of our registered users (which includes chief technology officers, project managers, business analysts and developers) agreed that a well-supported official NHS Digital forum would provide the help and support they need. Some of the current challenges reported by users: The long-term vision for the community is to address these challenges by making it easy for the health and care system to access official support, insight, and knowledge from NHS Digital. By creating an open environment, we hope that people in the community will also help each other. We have been testing a proof of concept (POC) solution for the Developer Community since September 2022. For the POC, we want to prove that an online community can open the door to important knowledge presently stuck inside NHS Digital in an efficient and accessible way and to see if it scales effectively. The POC will help us better understand the resource demands and give more space and time to gather input from users. We have chosen a dedicated community tool to test out our community concept because we found it had a great fit with our user needs. The Developer Community is available to all potential users of NHS Digital’s developer and integration hub. The public can view the topics, questions, and answers without logging in.

Discovering data standards together,"<p>Bharat Sharma, Senior Product Manager in the Standards and Interoperability team at NHS England, explains what they are doing to improve access to standards across the NHS.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like the old philosophical question ‘If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?’:</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 48px;"">If a standard is published but people don’t know about it, is it a standard?</p>","Digital It’s a bit like the old philosophical question ‘If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?’: If a standard is published but people don’t know about it, is it a standard? The Secretary of State’s Plan for digital health and social care and Data Saves Lives policy paper both clearly stated the central importance of standards in the digital transformation of our health and care system. Standards are critical to linking up systems, getting data to flow securely, to retaining public trust and to allowing health tech innovators to change what is possible for patients and healthcare staff. Merely publishing these things is not enough. It is clear that a standard is a standard in name only, unless it is accessible to all, understood by all, known about and actively used. Through discovery work with Marvell Consultancy, we found several barriers to adopting standards, including being difficult to find them as they are created and published by multiple organisations. This is why the Data Standards Directory is needed. The Plan for digital health and social care committed to “deliver a new digital service that will allow care providers and suppliers to identify which standards related to interoperability they must conform to and where to find the documentation”. Over a series of iterations, we changed the name from the ‘NHS Interoperability Standards Register’ to focus on what we are offering the user, rather than the back end. The new name and web address is still being tested but, so far, it appears to be helping users understand what we are here to do right now. As one remarked, “it does what it says on the tin."" We call our service the NHS Data Standards Directory. It launched in public beta on 1 September 2022. Our aim? To provide a single place to find standards on recording, handling and exchanging data in health and adult social care. At public beta right now, the main feature is to use the directory to find nationally recognised standards needed for interoperability in England, both those published and coming soon. You can currently search by areas of interest such as care settings, topics and types of standards. We are launching with this and looking to learn what features offer the most value to our users to define how we can grow. As the service is tested, we look forward to providing opportunities to discover more types and forms of standards around data, interoperability and tech, along with clear links to related content. This will save time and effort by bringing together standards from many different health and care bodies into a single place with clear, consistent language and quality. Meeting the criteria for government websites, the team has worked hard to show that everything it does and plans to do uses best practice, is user-centred and evidence-led from the start.

The reason is that the Developer hub was set up as a space where API consumers can learn about the NHS Digital onboarding journey and identify the APIs which they’d like to onboard with. It made sense to only represent our NHS Digital APIs in there and aimed to avoid confusion or dilute our onboarding journey for external suppliers and partners.  Our strategy hasn’t necessarily changed – we still want to present NHS Digital APIs on the catalogue, talk about our onboarding journey and how we make integration easier. However, we are mindful that we are in partnership with other organisations, either across the NHS or externally, and it makes sense to present relevant external specifications on the API and integration catalogue as well as our own.  We have recently brought our first external API onto the catalogue – the Ordnance Survey (OS) Places API – owned and maintained by Ordnance Survey.  People building healthcare software need an API that can retrieve and validate UK-based postal addresses, which is used for things like updating a patient’s address in the Personal Demographics Service (the national database of patient demographic information).  Our own API that does this, Gazetteer, is at the beginning of its sunsetting journey and has recently been deprecated.  This means that we won’t allow any more API consumers to onboard to it. While nothing changes in the short-to-medium term on licensing, service level agreements, and support offering, we will retire the Gazetteer API in the next couple of years, subject to all API consumers migrating away from it.   Instead of creating a new API to replace Gazetteer ourselves, we decided to add OS Places to our catalogue. It is a well-established API that is recommended by UK Government Services as the API of choice for looking up and validating addresses. Additionally, the Government Digital Service has mandated the use of the unique property reference number (UPRN), something that the existing Gazetteer API did not use whilst OS Places does – another good reason to include it in our catalogue. OS Places has already been used across the NHS including by the London Ambulance Service and so its addition to the NHS Digital API and integration catalogue should only increase its usage in other digital services in the NHS.  We are encouraging consumers to migrate to, or onboard with OS Places if they are developing new software, as soon as realistically possible. It’s free to use for public sector organisations if they become a Public Sector Geospatial Agreement (PSGA) member or for private sector software developers if they sign a contractor licence with a PSGA member.   As NHS Digital has been the only owner of the APIs within the API and integration catalogue, we have never needed to provide a tag or filter to represent ownership.  Now that we are presenting external APIs, we have updated the filter op","Thu, 10 Jul 2025 16:04:32 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/tech-talk/2022/why-were-opening-up-our-api-catalogue
6 things we learned from the COVID-19 home testing rollout,"<p>Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the home testing service enabled millions to order PCR tests and rapid lateral flow tests to their homes. Richard Taylforth, a Delivery Manager who worked on the service, explains how we did it.</p>

<p>The home testing service played a critical role in the national pandemic response, enabling people to test themselves quickly and accurately.</p>","Digital The home testing service played a critical role in the national pandemic response, enabling people to test themselves quickly and accurately. As we now learn to live with COVID-19, the service is leaner and more efficient, with flexible products capable of supporting future home testing requirements to improve public health outcomes. Here are our 6 key learnings since the service was first established: In designing and developing the initial home testing service, we drastically shortened the Agile software development lifecycle from weeks to days. Getting the minimal viable product (MVP) live was key. It went live on 24 April 2020, only a handful of days after work first started - a phenomenal achievement that meant keyworkers could order PCR tests to their homes to enable them to continue their critical work. We then iterated the service as necessary. It was extended to other vulnerable user groups, including those who were 65 or over and referrals from NHS 111 Online, before being made available to the general public. It was integrated with our wider platform for test site appointment bookings, meaning that people only had to enter their details once when choosing to either order a home test or book a physical test site appointment. Elective care patient testing was added as a new use case, which enabled NHS trusts to order PCR tests to the homes of patients with an upcoming hospital procedure, helping to stop the spread of the virus in hospital settings. We also expanded the service to cover blood antibody testing so eligible users could order at-home antibody tests to check whether they had previously had COVID-19. But perhaps most significant was introducing the ability to home order rapid lateral flow tests, meaning people could test themselves in their homes and get their result within 30 minutes, without the need for laboratory processing. Following the initial go-live, we quickly prioritised the need for the home testing service to operate 24/7, with zero downtime during deployments. To accommodate this approach, we created new architecture for the service that was more modular in nature, meaning we broke down tightly coupled code into smaller chunks that could be changed independently. We adopted the common blue/green deployment pattern which meant we had 2 separate production environments: 1 active and 1 inactive. The status of each environment would change during a release. The new version of the service was first deployed to the inactive environment and then, once the deployment was successfully complete and validated, user traffic was gradually transferred to this environment, so it became active. Since moving to this pattern, over 110 deployments have been successfully performed with zero downtime. We also invested in scaling the service to meet the highest anticipated demand. This was achieved through in-depth performance testing and improved optimisation. Creating a robust and reliable service meant we comfortably dealt w","Mon, 14 Jul 2025 10:59:46 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/tech-talk/2022/6-things-we-learned-from-the-covid-19-home-testing-rollout

We often call this onboarding. Within our own product teams, we have tended to follow a familiar process, scoping out a user need, designing, building and testing an API, getting approvals to get it live because that is what we are good at. And then – as we head toward that date – we realise we need to consider onboarding. Except that is when we have an experience that is familiar to many developers using our services; we find out that it can take quite a long time to get this right. It would have been worth planning well ahead. This is why our Onboarding process for APIs – NHS Digital is so useful. We have realised that this is an essential part of building our API products. If we are serious about our vision of the potential for digital technologies to improve health and care services, we need to get every step of that journey right, from designing to testing all the way through to onboarding. Onboarding, sometimes called assurance, is essential to make sure that products consume our APIs  safely and securely and it makes sense to think about what's needed during the build process. As Tony Heap mentioned in his recent blog Making integration easier for people building healthcare software, we identified back in 2019 that developers felt integrating with NHS services can be hard work, and that it is costly for people building healthcare software. It matters because it raises the barrier to entry, making for a less competitive and responsive market, at a time when we have all seen how responsiveness, particularly when it comes to digital solutions, is critical for NHS services. If you are helping your care provider rapidly deliver digital solutions, you need a clear and unambiguous list of things to do and a timeline to match.  Challenges identified by our users included overly complex assurance, difficulty in understanding all of the things that you are required to do, and a process that is not necessarily consistent from service to service. We need to change that. Our product team is thinking hard about how: This means: Our first version of digitised onboarding was to provide a web page. This was our first Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It described the Supplier Conformance List and was known as the SCAL spreadsheet. This helped facilitate and review the API onboarding process. It had an immediate impact because the web page answered a lot of their questions. Specialist terms such as SCAL or the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) had links to further information or an entry in the glossary of development terms or a link to documentation and standards. If they did need to ask a question, we make it very clear that they could contact our help and support team who we embedded directly within our onboarding product teams to drive a culture of support. Once we had helped developers to und","Mon, 07 Jul 2025 11:17:43 GMT",https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/tech-talk/2022/onboarding-shouldnt-be-an-afterthought
